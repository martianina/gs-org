# Technical Specification: Eddy the Developer Support Agent

## 1. Overview

Eddy is an AI-powered developer support agent designed to help developers by providing documentation-based assistance, generating code examples, and maintaining a knowledge base of common issues and solutions. Eddy uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, context-aware support based on project documentation and past conversations.

## 2. Core Functionality

### Documentation Support

- Answer questions using project documentation
- Provide relevant code examples and explanations
- Link to official documentation sources
- Keep track of frequently accessed documentation sections

### Code Assistance

- Generate code examples using RAG search
- Provide code explanations and best practices
- Suggest code improvements and optimizations
- Help debug common issues

### Knowledge Management

- Extract problems and solutions from chat discussions
- Build and maintain a searchable knowledge base
- Track common issues and their resolutions
- Create and update documentation based on developer interactions

## 3. Implementation

### Configuration

```typescript
const config: OnboardingConfig = {
  settings: {
    DOCUMENTATION_SOURCES: {
      name: 'Documentation Sources',
      description: 'List of documentation sources to index',
      required: true,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      value: [] as DocumentationConfig[],
      validation: (value: DocumentationConfig[]) => Array.isArray(value),
    },
    KNOWLEDGE_BASE: {
      name: 'Knowledge Base Configuration',
      description: 'Knowledge base settings and categories',
      required: true,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      value: {} as KnowledgeBaseConfig,
      validation: (value: KnowledgeBaseConfig) => typeof value === 'object',
    },
  },
};
```

### Character Definition

```typescript
const character: Character = {
  name: "Eddy",
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-anthropic",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord",
    "@elizaos/plugin-telegram",
    "@elizaos/plugin-node",
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
  ],
  settings: {Àù
    secrets: {
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID,
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_DISCORD_API_TOKEN,
      TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN,
    }
  }
};
```

## 4. Workflows

### Documentation Search

1. Receive developer question
2. Use RAG to search documentation
3. Generate contextual response
4. Provide relevant code examples
5. Track question for knowledge base

### Code Generation

````
Developer: How do I implement authentication using your SDK?

Eddy: I found some relevant documentation about authentication. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Auth } from '@your-sdk/auth';

const auth = new Auth({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  // Additional configuration
});

// Example authentication flow
async function authenticate() {
  try {
    const session = await auth.login({
      username: 'user@example.com',
      password: 'secure_password'
    });
    return session;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error);
  }
}
````

This example shows the basic authentication flow. You'll need to:

1. Install the SDK: `npm install @your-sdk/auth`
2. Set up your API key in environment variables
3. Implement error handling for your use case

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?

```

### Knowledge Extraction
1. Monitor chat discussions
2. Identify problem-solution patterns
3. Extract relevant code and context
4. Add to knowledge base with metadata
5. Link to related documentation

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Integration with code repositories for context-aware assistance
- Interactive code playground/REPL
- Automated documentation updates based on common questions
- AI-powered code review suggestions
- Integration with issue tracking systems
```
