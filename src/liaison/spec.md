# Technical Specification: Ruby the Community Liaison

## 1. Overview

Ruby is an AI-powered cross-organizational liaison agent designed to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing between different communities and organizations. She can be invited into various Discord servers, where she observes public discussions, identifies parallel conversations and interests, and creates comprehensive topic-based reports that can be shared across subscribing communities. Ruby serves as a central knowledge hub, helping different organizations understand what topics and initiatives are being discussed across communities, identifying potential synergies, and facilitating cross-community knowledge sharing.

## 2. Core Functionality

### Cross-Organization Intelligence

- Track public discussions across subscribed Discord servers
- Maintain awareness of active topics and initiatives in each community
- Identify parallel or similar discussions across different communities

- Facilitate cross-organizational knowledge sharing

### Knowledge Management

- Log and index all public channel discussions
- Create retrievable knowledge base of community activities
- Answer questions about historical discussions and decisions
- Track emerging topics and trends across communities
- Identify areas of shared interest or parallel work

### Information Synthesis

- Generate periodic reports highlighting cross-community activities
- Identify potential collaboration opportunities based on shared interests

- Link related discussions across communities

## 3. Implementation

### Data Models

```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  discordServerId: string;
  subscribedTopics: string[];
  reportSubscriptions: ReportType[];
}

interface CrossOrgReport {
  id: UUID;
  type: ReportType;
  date: string;
  content: {
    overview: string;
    parallelTopics: {
      topic: string;
      organizations: UUID[];
      recentDiscussions: string[];
      potentialSynergies: string;
    }[];
    organizationUpdates: {
      orgId: UUID;
      orgName: string;
      activeTopics: string[];
      recentHighlights: string[];
    }[];
  };
}

type ReportType = 'DAILY' | 'WEEKLY' | 'TOPIC_SPECIFIC';
```

### Configuration

```typescript
interface OrgConfig {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  // We should think about how we want to do this
  // Need to test the UX around inviting and sharing
  discordServerId: string;
  telegramServerId: string;
  slackServerId: string;
}

const config: OnboardingConfig = {
  settings: {
    ORGANIZATIONS: {
      name: 'Monitored Organizations',
      description: 'List of channels to monitor and their preferences',
      required: true,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      value: [] as OrgConfig[],
      validation: (value: OrgConfig[]) => Array.isArray(value),
    },
  },
};
```
