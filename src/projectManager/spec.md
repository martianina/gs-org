# Technical Specification: Jimmy the Project Manager

## 1. Overview

Jimmy is an AI-powered project manager agent designed to help teams manage projects, track progress, coordinate team members, and generate reports. Jimmy operates primarily through Discord at first, then Telegram, Slack and others. He serves as a central coordination point for project management, ensuring team members are aligned on priorities and deadlines.

## 2. Core Functionality

Jimmy provides two main functions:

### Project Management

- Create and maintain projects
- Track project progress through daily updates
- Identify and report on blockers and risks
- Generate weekly status reports

### Team Coordination

- Add team members to projects
- Track work hours and availability
- Daily check-ins with team members
- Follow up on missing updates

## 3. Implementation

### Data Models

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  teamMembers: UUID[]; // Team member IDs
}

interface TeamMember {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  availability: {
    workDays: (
      | 'Monday'
      | 'Tuesday'
      | 'Wednesday'
      | 'Thursday'
      | 'Friday'
      | 'Saturday'
      | 'Sunday'
    )[];
    workHours: {
      start: string; // HH:MM format
      end: string; // HH:MM format
    };
    timeZone: string; // e.g., "America/Los_Angeles"
    hoursPerWeek: number;
    employmentStatus: 'FULL_TIME' | 'PART_TIME' | 'FREELANCE' | 'NONE';
  };
}

interface DailyUpdate {
  id: UUID;
  teamMemberId: UUID;
  projectId: UUID;
  date: string; // ISO date format
  summary: string; // Paragraph summary of work done
}

interface Report {
  id: UUID;
  type: 'DAILY' | 'WEEKLY';
  projectId: UUID;
  generatedAt: string;
  summary: string;
  teamMemberSummaries: {
    teamMemberId: UUID;
    name: string;
    summary: string;
  }[];
}
```

### Configuration

```typescript
interface ProjectConfig {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  team: UUID[]; // Team member IDs
}

interface TeamMemberConfig {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  workDays: string[];
  workHours: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };
  timeZone: string;
  hoursPerWeek: number;
  employmentStatus: 'FULL_TIME' | 'PART_TIME' | 'FREELANCE' | 'NONE';
}

const config: OnboardingConfig = {
  settings: {
    PROJECTS: {
      name: 'Projects',
      description: 'List of projects to manage',
      required: true,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      value: [] as ProjectConfig[],
      validation: (value: ProjectConfig[]) => Array.isArray(value),
    },
    TEAM: {
      name: 'Team Members',
      description: 'List of team members',
      required: true,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      value: [] as TeamMemberConfig[],
      validation: (value: TeamMemberConfig[]) => Array.isArray(value),
    },
    REPORT_CHANNEL: {
      name: 'Report Channel',
      description: 'Discord channel for reports (DMs if not specified)',
      required: false,
      public: true,
      secret: false,
      validation: (value: string) => typeof value === 'string',
    },
  },
};
```

### Character Definition

```typescript
const character: Character = {
  name: 'Jimmy',
  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-anthropic',
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
    '@elizaos/plugin-discord',
    '@elizaos/plugin-node',
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
  ],
  settings: {
    secrets: {
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: process.env.PROJECT_MANAGER_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID,
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: process.env.PROJECT_MANAGER_DISCORD_API_TOKEN,
    },
  },
};
```

## 4. Workflows

### Onboarding

1. Jimmy joins server/team
2. Collects project and team information
3. Sets up data structures
4. Sends welcome message
5. Begins daily check-ins

### Daily Operations

1. Check in with each team member during their work hours
2. Follow up on missing updates
3. Generate end-of-week report after last team member update

### Weekly Report Format

```
ðŸ“Š Project Summary:
[Overall progress and key points]

ðŸ‘¥ Team Member Updates:
[Member Name]:
[Weekly work summary and current status]
```

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Linear Integration (task tracking, sprint planning)
- Google Meet Integration (meeting scheduling, calendar management)

# Script of example interactions

PM: Hey, I just need to get set up, you got a minute?
You: Sure
PM: What are you working on? Let's just pick one project or team to start small.
You: I'm building a SaaS AI email marketing company
PM: Great. Who else is on the team?
You: There's Jimmy, Gary and Laura.
PM: Okay cool, how should I contact them? Can you give me their preferred platform and username?
You: Yeah, Jimmy is jimmy.344 on Discord, Gary is garyisagenius, Laura is llwong1. All on Discord. Laura is also llwong1 on Telegram and seems ot be more responsive there.
PM: Got it. Can you tell me a bit about what each of them do and what they're working on?
You: Jimmy is our project manager, he's working on setting up our project management system and tracking tools. He's also helping coordinate between engineering and marketing. Gary is our compliance officer - he makes sure all our email campaigns and marketing materials follow regulations. He's currently reviewing our email templates and setting up compliance guidelines.
PM: Got it. And Laura?
You: Laura handles our marketing and social media. She's working on our social media strategy and creating content for our launch campaign. She's also designing some of our email templates. They're all pretty busy with the launch coming up, but they're good about responding to messages when you need them.
PM: Makes sense. Does the team have standups?
You: Not really, but I'd like to.
PM: Okay, how often do you want to have standups?
You: Monday and Thursday.
PM: Do you have a specific time that you know works for everyone on the team?
You: I think that 3pm PST works for everyone.
PM: Got it. Okay I think I have everything. I'll get in touch with all of them, if you could nudge them in a few minutes and let them know I've sent them a DM! And if you have any other team members I should check it with, just let me know!
You: Oh shoot. There's also Kelsey. She's our community manager. She's kind of the front door for a lot of new people, so we should keep her in the loop.
PM: No problem. How do I get in touch with her?
You: She's kelseyisthebest on Discord
PM: Okay got it!
PM: I tried to reach out to Kelsey, but her account is not accepting messages. Can you tell her to send me a DM?
You: Sure
<...>
PM: Okay, time for my daily report!

- I heard back from Laura and Kelsey. I'll give Gary a few more hours.
- Laura is working on a couple of marketing tasks, but she wasn't very specific
- Kelsey said she's just community managing and waiting for tasks
  All in all, I think Laura could be better utilized, and Kelsey is doing her job as I saw her chatting a lot with people in the Discord all day, but we could probably manage her with some tasks better. Let me know if you can get me in touch with Gary.
  You: Yeah he's not online today. Probably tomorrow.
  PM: Okay, no problem. I'll report back tomorrow with my update, let me know if you need anything!

PM: Hey there! I've been invited to join your team as a PM. I'd like to get a sense of your work hours and habits.
Employee: Yeah sure.
PM: Okay let's get started. How many hours per week do you work?
Employee: Uhh, like 45-50?
PM: Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe too much. What are your start and end times?
Employee: I start at 10am and end around 8pm every day.
PM: What time zone are you in?
Employee: I'm in Montenegro.
PM: Okay, so you work 10am-8pm Monday through Friday on MNT?
Employee: That sounds right.
PM: Alright then. I'll reach out to you around 7pm every day. Just need a quick few bulletpoints or summary of what you got done for the day. Is there a time you are

PM: Hey there! I've been invited to join your team as a PM. I'd like to get a sense of your work hours and habits.
Freelancer: Uh I just work on this part time when asked, like when I have a ticket
PM: Okay, got it! Are you currently working on anything?
Freelancer: Uh yeah I've been working on setting up my laptop so I could run the project.
PM: Okay, do you have an idea of when you'll be done with that, and would you want more tasks after that?
Freelancer: Uh I should be done today, maybe tomorrow at the latest, then I'm free for whatever
PM: Okay got it. I'll get back to you!
